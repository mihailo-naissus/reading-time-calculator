This code creates a simple web page that allows a user to input the number of words in a document and select a reading speed in words per minute. 
The calculator will then display the estimated time it will take the user to read the document.

The page includes some basic styling, such as font and color choices, as well as a form for the user to input their information. 
The form includes an input field for the number of words and a dropdown menu for the reading speed. 
There is also a submit button which will trigger the calculation and display the result.























The code calculates the estimated reading time by dividing the number of words by 
the reading speed and then converting the result from minutes to hours and minutes.

Here is the relevant code snippet:

  var wordsPerMinute = parseInt(form.readingSpeed.value, 10);
  var totalTimeMinutes = words / wordsPerMinute;
  var hours = Math.floor(totalTimeMinutes / 60);
  var minutes = Math.ceil(totalTimeMinutes % 60);

The wordsPerMinute variable is determined by parsing the value chosen by the user in the reading speed dropdown menu. 
This value is then used to divide the number of words in the document (stored in the words variable) to calculate the total reading time in minutes.

The hours variable is calculated by dividing the totalTimeMinutes by 60, which converts the time to hours. 
The minutes variable is calculated by taking the remainder of totalTimeMinutes divided by 60, 
which gives the remaining minutes after the hours have been accounted for.

Finally, the result is displayed to the user in the format "X hours Y minutes".
This code is semi acure at to moment. I am tryting to get better data.
